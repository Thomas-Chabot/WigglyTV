# Wiggly TV
This is an IPTV Add-on for [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/). It allows you to find and watch live TV channels.

## Installation
The app is hosted online by [Local Tunnel](http://stremio-addon-wigglytv.loca.lt/) with a button to install the app onto your stremio.
Alternatively, you can use the [manifest](http://stremio-addon-wigglytv.loca.lt/manifest.json) link to install it manually onto your Stremio by searching for the manifest in the Add-Ons section.

## Sources
The code is written with NodeJS and TypeScript and works using the [Stremio Addon SDK](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk).
